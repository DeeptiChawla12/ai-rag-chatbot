## 🚀 Overview

The Healthcare RAG Assistant helps users quickly access medical information from healthcare documents such as reports, policies, and patient education materials.

Instead of relying on generic AI responses, the system retrieves relevant medical content and generates answers grounded in real healthcare data.

## 🧠 What is RAG?

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** improves accuracy and reliability by:

1. Receiving a user query
2. Searching healthcare documents
3. Retrieving relevant medical content
4. Generating context-based responses

This approach reduces incorrect or hallucinated answers.
